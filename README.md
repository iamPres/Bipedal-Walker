# Bipedal-Walker
Bipedal walker training code

Positional navigation trained with unity genetic algorithm. It will be fine-tuned to pneumatic actuators using reinforcement learning


# Getting Started
Navigate to the project directory and run python3 python/genetic_algorithm.py for an example simulation. 
To make your own environment, add a new Unity project to the examples directory complete with an academy, brain, and agent. Build the executable and then place it in the python directory. See python/genetic_algorithm.py to access your agent through the unity python API.

# Requirements
See readme.txt; 
Requires unity 2018.1.0f2
